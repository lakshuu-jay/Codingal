Alex woke up to the sound of rain tapping on the window. He groaned, wishing he could stay in bed all day, but something inside told him today was different. 
Throwing on his jacket, he stepped outside, feeling the cool drops on his face.
As he walked through the empty streets, he noticed a small, glowing object under a puddle. 
Curious, he picked it up—it was a tiny, golden key. Questions swirled in his mind. What did it open? Who had left it here?
Determined to find out, Alex started searching every corner of the city, and little did he know, this tiny key was about to unlock the most unexpected adventure of his life.
