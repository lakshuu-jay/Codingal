The Science of Lightning

Lightning is a massive spark of electricity in the sky, caused by a buildup of charges in storm clouds—positive at the top and negative at the bottom. When the difference gets too big, electricity jumps across the air, heating it to about five times the Sun’s surface temperature. This sudden heat makes the air expand and creates thunder. Lightning is dangerous but also useful, as it helps turn nitrogen in the air into nutrients that plants can use, supporting life on Earth.
